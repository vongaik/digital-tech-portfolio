# CapSense AI – Sentiment Analysis and Response Generation Application

**Developed for Capgemini** – The sponsor of our technical work as a team of developers, testers, and technical writers using modern technologies.

---

## Overview

CapSense AI is an AI-powered Sentiment Analysis and Response Generation application designed to revolutionize customer service by analyzing customer feedback and generating empathetic, brand-aligned responses.

The system leverages machine learning for sentiment and emotion detection, sarcasm identification, and integrates advanced language models (Phi-3, later Phi-4) to generate personalized responses. It enables batch processing of feedback, providing actionable insights and automating routine tasks while maintaining a consistent brand voice.

This project showcases full-stack development capabilities, AI model integration, and practical experience in deploying enterprise-grade applications on Microsoft Azure.

## My Contributions

- **Frontend Development**  
  Built the responsive and interactive React frontend using Vite. Implemented:
  - Text input and CSV file upload for single and batch feedback.
  - Modular Sentiment Analysis Report UI with components for sentiment, emotion, sarcasm, aspect-based sentiment, and AI-generated responses.
  - State management, API integration with Axios, and conditional rendering to handle asynchronous backend responses.

- **Phi Model Integration**  
  - Initially integrated **Phi-3 Mini** model via Azure AI Studio for context-aware, empathetic response generation.  
  - Updated payload format from OpenAI-style requests to Phi-compatible requests.  
  - Later upgraded to **Phi-4**, ensuring seamless response generation and fallback mechanisms.

- **Emotion Detection Model**  
  - Built and trained a **Naïve Bayes classifier** from scratch using 42,000+ customer feedback entries.  
  - Achieved **55.81% accuracy** across six primary emotions (anger, joy, anticipation, neutral, disgust, sadness).  
  - Integrated the model into the Flask backend for real-time emotion classification.

- **Backend Integration & Deployment Support**  
  - Configured Flask APIs for batch and single-feedback processing.  
  - Assisted in deploying the backend on **Azure Virtual Machines**, ensuring proper environment setup, port configuration, and database connectivity.  
  - Helped debug server errors, install dependencies (e.g., NLTK), and ensure classifier functionality.
